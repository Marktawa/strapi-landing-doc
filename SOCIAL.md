I just published a new article on my Dev.to:

Build a Landing Page with Strapi and Vanilla HTML

I just published a step-by-step guide showing how to create and deploy a simple landing page using:

âœ… Strapi as a backend for managing contact form submissions  
âœ… [Strapi Cloud](https://strapi.io/cloud) for hosting the backend  
âœ… Vanilla HTML, CSS & JS for the frontend  
âœ… A working contact form that submits leads directly to your Strapi Cloud dashboard  
âœ… Cloudflare Pages for fast global hosting  

This article presents a simple proof-of-concept landing page to demonstrate how Strapi can be integrated with a basic HTML/CSS/JS frontend.
